					<h3>Warm Up Activity</h3>
					<p>Try starting the day by doing what we did last time</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Open your text editor and create a program</li>
						<li>Try running a program that prints anything.</li>
						<li>Then try creating a minecraft object by using minecraft.Minecraft.create() and store it in a variable called mc.</li>
						<li>Try posting to chat. If you feel like you don't remember any of this, then the answer is on the next page.</li>
						<li>Save and run the program</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>The Answers :|</h3>
					<pre><code>
from mcpi import minecraft
print('Hello')
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
mc.postToChat('Hello')
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>So what does each line mean?</h3>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
from mcpi import minecraft
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">This line takes minecraft from someone else.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
print('Hello')
					</code></pre>		
					<p class="fragment">This line prints Hello.</p>		
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">This line creates the minecraft object.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
mc.postToChat('Hello')
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">This line actually posts to the chat.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Quick Review</h3>
					<p>What does putting things in quotes do? What is a string?</p>
					<p>How do you give something to a method? What is a method</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
method('Hello')
					</code></pre>
					<p>What is a number? How do you make one in Python?</p>
					<p>What is an object?</p>
					<p>What is the terminal?</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="http://www.wpclipart.com/signs_symbol/safety_signs/caution_sign_w_exclamation.png">
					<h3 style="color:black;">The following parts will be boring. Please try to stay awake. </h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Old Terminal</h3>
					<p>This was how computers used to work. They didn't use mice and only used the keyboard. How did they get things done?</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px" class="fragment">
						The terminal uses commands to get things done. It gives us full control over the system. Many things that you can click just use the terminal behind the scenes.
						It can be quite useful. When using the terminal, you use it in a directory and "work" in it. First, you type your command. Then, you give a space and type the stuff you want 
						to give to the command. This terminal can be accessed by clicking the black rectangle at the top or going to Menu->Accessories->Terminal. An example of a command is below.
					</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
# Lists everything in the current directory
dir
# Creates a directory named hello
mkdir hello
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Our Commands</h3>
					<p>
						The terminal is a place where you can enter commands directly to the computer. It doesn't need fancy graphics and it is where we run our program. We can go to different parts
						of the computer by using the "cd" command. "python" is how we run our program.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Objects</h3>
					<p>What is an object in real life. Can we create a definition?</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						An object is basically something with properties like color, texture, and shape. In Python, these can be held in different types of information. It can also have a method
						attached. Look at the example below. We can access the some property of an object by using the . (literally!)
					</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
object.property
object.method()
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
					</code></pre>
					<p>Based on this, what do you think mc is? What is minecraft and what does it represent? Is it an object, a number, or a string?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>A Bit Of Addition</h3>
					<p>Ok time for a bit more boring stuff before we can get back to minecraft</p>
					<p>What should the code below print?</p>
					<pre><code>
print('2' + '2')
print(2 + 2)
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Finally, Back to the Minecraft (with Doc Brown)(Anyone who gets that reference is amazing)</h3>
					<p>Ok, so we are going to learn some other things about the minecraft object that we have created. I know the example looks like a wall of text.</p>
					<pre><code>
from mcpi import minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
# Hastags begin comments and are ignored!
# Sets the block at x, y, and z to the block id
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockId)
# Have every line of code begin on the next line
# This gets the position of the player as three variables
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>One Last Thing</h3>
					<p>Try seeing some of this stuff for yourself. I know it can get boring at times but hang in there!</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<p>Any questions?</p>
						<p>If you need help, please look through the examples again on this presentation.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="fragment">Also, when using setBlock(), you need to have someone reconnect to see what you have made.</p>
